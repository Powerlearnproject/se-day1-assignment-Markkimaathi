#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.

reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement Analysis – Gathering and defining system requirements.

Planning – Creating project plans, schedules, and resource allocation.

Design – Designing system architecture and components.

Implementation – Writing and developing the software code.

Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs through different testing strategies.

Deployment – Releasing the software to users.

Maintenance – Performing updates and bug fixes over time.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Writes and maintains code, implements features, and fixes bugs.

Quality Assurance Engineer – Tests software for functionality, performance, and security issues.

Project Manager – Oversees the project timeline, ensures deliverables are met, and manages communication between stakeholders.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing. Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.

Version Control Systems (VCS) – Track changes to code, support collaboration, and prevent data loss. Examples: Git
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time 



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Tests individual components for correctness.

Integration Testing – Ensures multiple components work together.

System Testing – Evaluates the entire system's functionality.

Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets business requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective inputs for AI models to generate useful and relevant responses. It is crucial for improving AI performance in applications such as chatbots, content generation, and automation.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt: "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence in healthcare, focusing on diagnostics and patient care."

Why is it better? The improved prompt is specific, targeted, and provides clear instructions, leading to more accurate and relevant AI responses.
